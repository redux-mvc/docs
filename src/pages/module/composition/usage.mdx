## Module Composition

- To mix a module in follow this steps:

  1. Use the *merge* decorator from *redux-mvc*
  2. Continue creating the module as usual 

  ```ts
  import * as R from "ramda"
  import { merge, createModule } from "@redux-mvc/core"

  import model from "./model"

  const CounterAndSearchbar = R.compose(
      createModule,
      ...
      merge(counter),
      merge(searchBar)
  )(model)

  ```

  **Note:** remember function composition works from right to left
