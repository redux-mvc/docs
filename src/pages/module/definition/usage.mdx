<PageDescription>

*Modules* are created by enhancing or decorating a *model*.

</PageDescription>

# Decorators

The module definition is based in using *decorators* that incrementally add functionality to a *model* or *module*.

- The minimum module requirements are:

  1. Adding the *reducer*
  2. Adding the *lifeCycle* methods (for creating the store object)
  
  ```js
  const newModule = R.compose(
      addLifecycle(),
      addReducer(),
  )(model)

  ```

  **Note:** remember function composition works from right to left
  
- The *decorators* api is just objects and function composition, then *redux-mvc* gives you the possibility of writing your own *addReducer* and *addLifecycle*, or any other *decorator* to customize the framework.

  E.g.: The *createModule* decorator is the composition of *addLifecycle* and *addReducer*, and you can define your own.

    ```js
    const createModule = R.compose(
        addLifecycle(),
        addReducer(),
    )

    ```
