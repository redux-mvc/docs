*Modules* can be rendered with different instances, allowing a module to be reused many times in one screen while keeping it's own state per instance.

## Module Instances

There's 3 ways to work with instances:

  1. No instance, then the module will use the *DEFAULT_INSTANCE_ID* ("default")

  ```ts
  import Counter from "ui-kit/Counter/View"

  const Counters = () => (
      <div>
          <Counter />
          ...
      </div>
  )

  ```

  2. Constant instance

  ```ts
  import Counter from "ui-kit/Counter/View"

  const Counters = () => (
      <div>
          <Counter instanceId="apples" />
          <Counter instanceId="oranges" />
          ...
      </div>
  )

  ```

  3. Dynamic instance

  ```ts
  import Counter from "ui-kit/Counter/View"

  const Counters = ({ instances = []}) => (
      <div>
      { 
        R.map(
          instance => <Counter instanceId={instance} />, 
          instances
        ) 
      }
      </div>
  )

  ```
  
  **Note:** The *Counter* component should be a *connected* component.
